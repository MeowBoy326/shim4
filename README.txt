	Music and sound support
	Datafile archives
	Pixel and TrueType fonts
	Direct3D 9 and OpenGL backends
	GUI system built on TGUI6
	Images
	Sprites
	Joystick, keyboard, touch/mouse input

And a lot more.

NOTE: at some point glm stopped working. The one included in external/
needs to be used until I can find a fix.
