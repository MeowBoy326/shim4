Here is the documentation of the MML syntax:

Special definitions start with a @. Everything else belongs in a channel and every channel needs a name
from A to Z which should be the first thing on the line unless it's @ or a blank line.

The definitions and effects you can use are:

@S - Define a sample
	@S0 = { example.flac }
	@S1 = { another.flac }

@VAS - Volume envelope (single note). The volumes are between 0 and 255.
	The difference between this and @VAM is with @VAS, the volume shift is applied to each note
	@VAS0 = { 32 0 } ; this will play notes at channel volume fading to 32 then to 0

@VAM - Volume envelope (multi-note)
	Similar to @VAS except the volume applies across the span of the @VAM elements instead of
	applying for each note within the statements

@VO - Volume offset envelope. Volumes in the envelope are offsets from current volume instead of
	absolute volumes.

@D - Dutycycle envelope. A duty cycle of 128 is a square wave and it can slide either way.
	@D0 = { 128 32 } ; slides the duty cycle from channel to 128 to 32

@PO - Pitch offset envelope. Slides the pitch by the specified number of Hz.
	@PO0 = { 0 -256 0 } ; the first number is used to start the effect at an offset. Here it starts at note frequency
			    plus 0 Hz and slides down 256 Hz then to 0 again

@PN - Pitch to note envelope. Slides to pitch to the note. The number is an octave
	@PN0 = { c4 c5 c4 c6 } ; Slides the pitch to C at different octaves

@PA - Absolute pitch shift. The values are in Hz.

@R - Reverb
	@R0 = { 5 0 1000 255 32 } ; 5 reverberations, 0 is the falloff interpolator explained with interpolators
				    falloff time in MS, start volume of reverb, end volume of reverb

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Within a channel, there are many symbols you can use. This is an attempt to document all of them, hopefully
I don't forget any this time...

abcdefg - Notes
r - Rest (silence)
w - wait (continues the same note)
. - After one of the above, a dot adds half the length of the note to the total length. Two dots adds
	half plus quarter and so on.
	All of these can be proceeded by a number that is the length of the note. E.g. a1 is a whole note.

^ - a tie. This continues an identical note, like a wait.

+ - is a sharp e.g. a+
- - is a flat

l - Change the default note length. e.g., l16 makes it 16th notes

t - change the tempo of the channel. e.g. t200 for 200 bpm

o - set the octave e.g., o4

> - down an octave

< - up an octave

@S - e.g., @S0 will use the sample defined as S0 to play the notes in this channel

@ Envelopes and Reverb
	To use any of the envelopes or reverb, you need to specify them on a section of notes in a channel.
	E.g., A @R0 abcdfgcde @R0 abcd @R0 cadbd @R0 ; the first @R0 turns on Reverb channel 0, the next turns
	it off and so on

@TYPE - sets the generator type.
	E.g., @TYPE0 sets the generator to a pulse wave (default duty cycle is 128 on a pulse wave.)
	The types are:
		0 - pulse
		1 - noise type 1
		2 - sawtooth
		3 - sine
		4 - triangle
		5 - noise type 2

@CV - Volume curve interpolator setting. This is for @VAS etc which slide the volume.
	The following list of interpolators applies to all envelopes where the type
	of curve can be specified, like pitch envelopes, reverb etc...
		0 - linear
		1 - hermite
		2 - slow fade
		3 - sine
		4 - pulse

@CP - Same as @CV but for pitch

@CD - Same as @CV but for dutycycle

@RT - this can change phase reset for pitch envelopes
	For example if you had @PO0 = { 0 -16 0 16 0 } it will reset the phase of
	the note between each segment of the envelope which can cause a little
	crackle. If you set it to @RT4 (maybe with @CP1) it will play through
	it smoothly without resetting the phase. If you set @RT2 it will reset it halfway through.

Buzz
	Each generator can have buzz added to the waveform it generates. It's basically a hack at this point...
	If you had a pulse wave in a channel then added sine wave buzz you can imagine the wave being square
	with a slight (or big) sine at each level.
	@BF - buzz frequency. It's actually the number of phases of buzz per phase of the note
		so @BF7 would have 7 phases of buzz on the note
	@BV - buzz volume (0 to 255)
	@BTYPE - buzz type. Same as @TYPE

@F - Fade boolean. I think turning this off might introduce some clicks

v - Channel volume, 0 to 255 e.g. v255

m - mix volume 0 to 255

y - Change dutycycle of channel. Applies only to @TYPE0 (pulse.)

s - toggle WAV stretching or not. By default (s0) WAVs are played back without stretching to note length
